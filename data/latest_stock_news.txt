Prabhudas Lilladher Capital is betting big on India’s consumption revival,
naming Titan, Britannia and DOMS Industries among its top stock picks. The
brokerage also backed structural plays such as Adani Ports & SEZ and financial
heavyweight ICICI Bank, arguing that domestic demand, buoyed by tax cuts, lower
inflation and easier credit, will drive the next leg of growth. Overweight on
banks, healthcare, consumer; risks stem from U.S. tariffs, geopolitics, and
sector-specific pressures.PL projects Nifty EPS at Rs 1,254 for FY26 and £1,445

in line with its 15-year average. It pegs its base-case target at 27,609, a
modest increase from its prior 26,889 forecast. In the mid-cap and small-cap

Full Article Summary:
TCS shares in focus as IT major sets up new AI transformation unit. Amit Kapur,
who previously headed TCS’s UK and Ireland business, will lead the unit from
September. The launch of the AI and services transformation division comes
barely a month after the IT major announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs. The move
has heightened concerns that India's $283 billion outsourcing industry—long a
source of steady employment—may face more layoffs as AI adoption accelerates.
With customers holding back on discretionary tech investments, companies like
TCS are increasingly betting on AI-led solutions to reviviate the industry. The
company said in a memo that it has made significant strides in AI by scaling
capabilities, reskilling its workforce, and strengthening partnerships. The memo
also stated that a two-decade veteran at the firm who most recently led TCS's UK
and Irish business, has been appointed chief of the unit and will formally
assume charge in September. For confidential support call the Samaritans in the

Full Article Summary:
HDFC Bank share price fell over a percent on Tuesday after the stock turned ex-
date for bonus issue. HDFC Bank bonus ratio was 1:1, which means shareholders
will receive one bonus equity share of face value Re 1 for every fully paid-up
equity share held. The ex-bonus adjustment is purely an accounting process and
does not impact the firm’s fundamentals or the overall value of investment,
according to Mehta Equities Ltd, senior VP (Research) The bonus share record
date for determining the eligible shareholders to receive bonus equity shares is
today, August 26, 2025. Investors holding HD FC Bank shares as of this date will
be entitled to receive the bonus shares. The share price typically adjusts in
line with the bonus ratio, but the overallvalue of an investor's holdings
remains unchanged. The bank's share price has delivered a strong 74% return in
the last five years. The bonus issue involves the distribution of additional
shares to existing shareholders at no extra cost, the bank said in a statement.
It is not clear whether the bonus issue will be followed up with an IPO or a
share buyback. The company did not comment on the possibility of an IPO in the
near future, however, a spokesperson said the bank would not comment further.

Full Article Summary:
HDFC Bank's shares appeared to have tanked over 50% compared to the previous
close on Dalal Street in early trade. Price drop is a technical adjustment, not
financial trouble or loss. It was the result of a 1:1 bonus share issue, which
came into effect as the stock started trading ex-bonus on both the NSE and BSE.
Shareholders who owned HDFC Bank shares on this date are eligible to receive one
fully paid-up bonus share for every share held. The move has no impact on the
bank’s market capitalisation or the actual value of investors’ holdings, since
the number of shares increases while the price per share reduces
proportionately. By issuing bonus shares, companies make their stock more
affordable, improve liquidity in the market, and encourage greater participation
from retail investors. The record date for the bonus issue was set as August 26,
2025. The bank says it is part of its broader capital strategy to expand its
shareholder base while keeping the stock price at a level that remains
accessible to more investors. For confidential support call the Samaritans in

Full Article Summary:
Shares of HDFC Bank slipped 1.8% to their intraday low of Rs 955 on the BSE on
Thursday after a large block deal saw 1.56 million shares change hands. The
transaction came just a day after the bank’s stock price adjusted to reflect its
recent 1:1 bonus share issuance, which had already taken effect on Tuesday.
Block deals are bulk trades between big investors, executed via a separate
window to avoid adding volatility to regular market trading. Details of the
buyer and seller in the block deal were not immediately available. The decline
in the stock follows a significant technical adjustment earlier this week,
whenHDFC Bank began trading ex-bonus after issuing one additional share for
every share held. The move doubled the number of outstanding shares and reduced
the stock price in proportion, without altering the bank's overall market
capitalisation or shareholder value. The exercise was part of its broader
strategy to improve liquidity in the counter and widen retail participation. The
stock opened about 62% lower than the pre-bonUS closing price, in line with the
bonus ratio, and traded in the range ofRs 982.20–Rs 986.30. The adjustment
reflected the mechanical dilution from the bonus issue rather than any change in
the company's fundamentals.

Full Article Summary:
Reliance Industries' AGM on August 29 is highly anticipated, with shareholders
eager for updates on the Jio and Retail IPO timelines. UBS has resumed coverage
on RIL and raised its target price to Rs 1,550, citing value unlocking potential
in less cyclical and faster growing businesses of both retail and Jio. Reliance
shares, which are already up over 13% so far in 2025, have fallen 2.5% in the
last one week amid weakness in the market due to impact of Trump tariff as well
as low expectations from the AGM. RIL chairman had mentioned that they will look
to IPO telco and retail within 5 years but there has been no update since then.
As the majority of strategic business announcements are made during AGM, many
investors are expecting incremental updates on potential IPO timelines for Jio,
Retail and energy. Market analysts are also keen on insights into Jio's AI
strategy, particularly JioBrain platform. Further expectations include progress
reports on the new energy business, JIO and Retail business growth targets, and
the company's petchem expansion plans. For confidential support call the

Full Article Summary:
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) share price traded over a percent lower on
Thursday ahead of the company’s 48th Annual General Meeting (AGM) Chairman
Mukesh Ambani is set to address nearly 44 lakh shareholders. Reliance share
price declined as much as 1.23% to ₹1,368.25 apiece on the BSE. Despite this
rally, analysts believe Reliance Industries’ valuations remain attractive and
continue to maintain a positive outlook on the stock. US President Donald Trump
has imposed an additional 25% tariffs on India for importing Russian crude oil.
RIL is directly impacted by the move.Investors will be watching closely for
Ambani's comments on crude sourcing, along with potential updates on the long-
awaited IPO of its telecom arm Jio, and the company's strategy for leveraging
artificial intelligence (AI) across its businesses. The stock could recover if
these issues abate, according to JPMorgan, which has an ‘Overweight’ rating and
a share price target of � 1,695 apiece for September 2026. The share price has
gained 12 % in 2025 so far, sharply outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50’S 4.5%
rise. The implied discount has narrowed only marginally in 2025, as valuations
for peers Bharti Airtel and Avenue Supermarts (DMart) have also risen,
preserving the relative value proposition.

Full Article Summary:
Reliance Industries AGM set to reveal updates on crude tariffs, Jio IPO, and AI
push - track the key announcements now. The timing of the AGM coincides with
U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to slap an additional 25% tariff on India
for buying Russian crude. Investors will be looking for how the company plans to
manage sourcing costs. Any clarity here could directly sway Reliance Industries
stock movement. The company currently commands a market capitalisation of Rs
18.74 lakh crore. Reliance shares have a 52-week high of Rs 1,551 and a 52 -week
low of Rs 2,071. The stock has declined by about 3%. On a six-month basis, it is
up 15%, while on a one-year basis it is down nearly 7%. The company has been
expanding across energy, media, and connectivity, and analysts expect Mukesh
Ambani to outline how AI could tie these businesses together, from smarter
retail supply chains to new digital offerings. The AGM is often the platform for
big announcements. With Jio at the centre of Reliance's consumer business, any
signal on IPO plans could be a big driver for the stock. See full list of our
