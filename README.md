# AI Stock News Summarizer

## Project Overview
AI Stock News Summarizer is an advanced Python-based application that fetches and summarizes the latest stock-related news articles using AI. The project utilizes **Google News RSS**, **BeautifulSoup**, and **Newspaper3k** for data extraction, while **Facebook's BART model** is employed for summarization. The goal is to provide traders and investors with concise, high-quality summaries of stock news for better decision-making.

## Features
- Fetches stock news from **Google News RSS**.
- Extracts full article text using **Newspaper3k** and **BeautifulSoup**.
- Summarizes articles using **Facebook's BART model** via Hugging Face's Transformers library.
- Utilizes **Selenium** as a fallback for retrieving full articles.
- Supports **batch processing** for Nifty 500 stocks.
- Saves summarized news to a structured text file.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (for AI-powered summarization)
- **Feedparser** (for parsing RSS feeds)
- **BeautifulSoup** (for web scraping)
- **Newspaper3k** (for extracting full article text)
- **Selenium** (for fetching JavaScript-rendered content)
- **Torch (PyTorch)** (for running AI models on GPU)
